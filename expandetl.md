To increment the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for loading a Data Vault Proof of Concept (POC), let's expand upon the previous SQL code to include the steps for extracting data from source systems, 
transforming it to fit the Data Vault model, and loading it into the corresponding tables. Below is the full code for the ETL process:

```sql
-- Step 1: Extract data from source systems (Assuming source tables exist)
-- Example source tables: PolicyholderSource, PolicySource, ClaimSource

-- Step 2: Transform data to fit the Data Vault model
-- Transformations may include data cleansing, joining, and mapping to the Data Vault structure

-- Load data into staging tables for each entity
-- Create staging tables
CREATE TABLE PolicyholderStaging (
    PolicyholderID INT,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Age INT,
    Address VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE PolicyStaging (
    PolicyID INT,
    Type VARCHAR(50),
    PremiumAmount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE ClaimStaging (
    ClaimID INT,
    PolicyID INT,
    Amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    ClaimDate DATE
);

-- Load data into staging tables from source tables
INSERT INTO PolicyholderStaging (PolicyholderID, Name, Age, Address)
SELECT PolicyholderID, Name, Age, Address
FROM PolicyholderSource;

INSERT INTO PolicyStaging (PolicyID, Type, PremiumAmount)
SELECT PolicyID, Type, PremiumAmount
FROM PolicySource;

INSERT INTO ClaimStaging (ClaimID, PolicyID, Amount, ClaimDate)
SELECT ClaimID, PolicyID, Amount, ClaimDate
FROM ClaimSource;

-- Step 3: Load data into the Data Vault model

-- Load data into Hubs
INSERT INTO PolicyholderHub (PolicyholderID)
SELECT DISTINCT PolicyholderID
FROM PolicyholderStaging;

INSERT INTO PolicyHub (PolicyID)
SELECT DISTINCT PolicyID
FROM PolicyStaging;

INSERT INTO ClaimHub (ClaimID)
SELECT DISTINCT ClaimID
FROM ClaimStaging;

-- Load data into Links
INSERT INTO PolicyholderPolicyLink (PolicyholderID, PolicyID)
SELECT ps.PolicyholderID, p.PolicyID
FROM PolicyholderStaging ps
JOIN PolicyStaging p ON ps.PolicyholderID = p.PolicyholderID;

INSERT INTO PolicyClaimLink (PolicyID, ClaimID)
SELECT p.PolicyID, c.ClaimID
FROM PolicyStaging p
JOIN ClaimStaging c ON p.PolicyID = c.PolicyID;

-- Load data into Satellites
INSERT INTO PolicyholderSatellite (PolicyholderID, Name, Age, Address)
SELECT PolicyholderID, Name, Age, Address
FROM PolicyholderStaging;

INSERT INTO PolicySatellite (PolicyID, Type, PremiumAmount)
SELECT PolicyID, Type, PremiumAmount
FROM PolicyStaging;

INSERT INTO ClaimSatellite (ClaimID, Amount, ClaimDate)
SELECT ClaimID, Amount, ClaimDate
FROM ClaimStaging;

-- Step 4: Clean up staging tables (optional)
-- DROP TABLE PolicyholderStaging;
-- DROP TABLE PolicyStaging;
-- DROP TABLE ClaimStaging;
```

This code outlines the complete ETL process for loading a Data Vault POC:

1. Extract: Data is extracted from source systems and loaded into staging tables.
2. Transform: Data is transformed to fit the Data Vault model structure.
3. Load: Transformed data is loaded into the corresponding hubs, links, and satellites.
4. Clean up: Staging tables can be dropped after loading data into the Data Vault model (optional).
